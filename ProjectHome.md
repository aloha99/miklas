A computer game framework, which is used as an artificial life simulation shows the problem pattern. “Miklas” was developed from the computer game “Pacman”, which is based on JGameGrid. The Game Engine of JGameGrid is used to create a simple agent simulation framework, which is easily accessible for developers with little experience in programming. It allows rapid deployment and testing of cognitive architectures like  Artificial Recognition System (ARS). Compared to the original “Pacman” computer game, everything in the “world” is an agent, which can have interactions with other agents. Another feature was to make the game extremely configurable, in order to allow a user to easily set up a world with agents and interaction rules through configuration without much programming.
